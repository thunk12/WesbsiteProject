      Since September of 2022, Sneed's has always strived for a world where one
      can rent a snail at any time, for a price that they can afford. Since our
      founding, we have allowed <strong>21,709</strong> people to finally
      experience their dreams of renting a snail.

      From the day of his birth in 1970, Silas Sneed knew what he wanted to do:
      Make Snails affordable to everyone in his home town of Agloe. After 50
      years of hard work, Silas can finally say that he's done it. Born at an
      extremely young age, Silas struggled to make friends throughout his life.
      In his University years, he turned to snail farming as a way to alleviate
      the loneliness and boredom which pervaded his life. To his surprise, he
      turned out to be quite good at it, and he quickly dropped out of
      university to farm snails full time, eventually becoming a millionare
      twice-over by the age of 30, owning numerous successful ranches.

      However, Silas's ambitions grew larger, and he soon began renting out his
      snails to people around the city. Sales eventually grew to the point where
      in 2020, Silas realized he needed to expand worldwide. After 2 Years of
      sleepless nights and snail research, Silas Sneed's Snail Rentals
      officially launched its website, allowing millions of people worldwide to
      rent snails from the comfort of their own home.
