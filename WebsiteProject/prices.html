        This teensy little slug has a remarkable ability. This slug feeds
        primarily on algae, and can store the chloroplasts in the spikes along
        its back. These chloroplasts allow the animal to photosynthesize,
        earning it the nickname of "<i>The Solar Powered Slug</i>"!. These
        interesting abilities, cute appearance, and ease of care make it perfect
        for classroom or home environments.

        is their vivid and awe-inspiring colours make them an amazing way to
        entertain guests and teach people about the wonders of the phylum
        <i>Gastropoda</i>. This snail requires extremely specialized care, and
        any customers who wish to rent them must first pass a 3-week course, and
        only purchase approved habitats.
